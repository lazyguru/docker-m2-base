# Magento2 Docker base image

This image contains the base CentOS 6 image plus package updates and installing some essential packages for development (gcc, etc..)

This package is inspired by the docker setup provided by Magento [here](https://github.com/magento/magento2-docker).  I just took split up 
each process to be in its own container per Docker best practices
